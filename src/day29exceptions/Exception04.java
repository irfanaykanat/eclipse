	 * 1) throws , throw, try, catch , finally, compile time exception (checked), runtime exception (unchecked)
	 * 2) Differences between "throw" and "throws"
	 * 		i) "throw" is used in method body but "throws" is used in method name line 
	 * 		ii) After "throw" keyword we create an object by using Exception classes but after "throws"
	 * 			we type just the name of Exception class
	 * 		iii) After  "throws" keyword you can use multiple Exception class names by separating the by comma 
	 * 			but after "throw" keyword you can create just a single object 
	 * 			Note: After "throws" keyword parent and child Exception classes can not be used together, java removes child
	 * 				  replace parent automatically 
	 * 	
	 * 		iv) "throws" can be used once at most in a method "throw" can be used many times in a method body
